# Standard IPFS presentation

This presentation was given with the equalit.ie team in Feb-2017.
It's very rough and not even close to the usual quality of our presentations.

It's based on remark.js, which renders the embedded markdown in the browser.

It's on IPFS too: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmNUmtyd7voq5DSCHRckvbYyWHfaXEG4rrERAdGPamp1PD/#1

A few of the slides have been extracted from @jbenet's slidedecks:

## Overview

IPFS ([the InterPlanetary File System](https://github.com/ipfs/faq/issues/76)) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open.

IPFS is a distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. In some ways, this is similar to the original aims of the Web, but IPFS is actually more similar to a single bittorrent swarm exchanging git objects. You can read more about its origins in the paper [IPFS - Content Addressed, Versioned, P2P File System](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs/blob/master/papers/ipfs-cap2pfs/ipfs-p2p-file-system.pdf?raw=true).

IPFS is becoming a new major subsystem of the internet. If built right, it could complement or replace HTTP. It could complement or replace even more. It sounds crazy. It _is_ crazy.

### Quick Summary

IPFS is a protocol:
- defines a content-addressed file system
- coordinates content delivery
- combines Kademlia + BitTorrent + Git

IPFS is a filesystem:
- has directories and files
- mountable filesystem (via FUSE)

IPFS is a web:
- can be used to view documents like the web
- files accessible via HTTP at `https://ipfs.io/<path>`
- browsers or extensions can learn to use the `ipfs://` URL or `dweb:/ipfs/` URI schemes directly
- hash-addressed content guarantees authenticity

IPFS is modular:
- connection layer over any network protocol
- routing layer
- uses a routing layer DHT (kademlia/coral)
- uses a path-based naming service
- uses bittorrent-inspired block exchange

IPFS uses crypto:
- cryptographic-hash content addressing
- block-level deduplication
- file integrity + versioning
- filesystem-level encryption + signing support

IPFS is p2p:
- worldwide peer-to-peer file transfers
- completely decentralized architecture
- **no** central point of failure

IPFS is a cdn:
- add a file to the filesystem locally, and it's now available to the world
- caching-friendly (content-hash naming)
- bittorrent-based bandwidth distribution

IPFS has a name service:
- IPNS, an SFS inspired name system
- global namespace based on PKI
- serves to build trust chains
- compatible with other NSes
- can map DNS, .onion, .bit, etc to IPNS

## How IPFS Works

To learn more about how IPFS works take a look at the [Papers](#ipfs-papers) or [Talks](#ipfs-talks). You can also explore the [Specs](https://github.com/ipfs/specs) in writing.

## More About IPFS

The IPFS project seeks to evolve the infrastructure of the Internet and the Web, with many things we've learned from successful systems, like [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [BitTorrent](http://bittorrent.org/), [Kademlia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia), [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/), and many, many more. This is the sort of thing that would have come out of ARPA/DARPA/IETF/BellLabs in another age. IPFS is a Free Open Source project, with hundreds of contributors.

### Current State of IPFS

**IPFS is a work in progress!**

Please note that IPFS is a work in progress. It is an ambitious plan to make the internet more free, open, secure, and high performance. It builds on the good ideas of numerous battle-tested distributed systems.

Today, there is one main IPFS Protocol implementation (in [Go](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs)) with [more on the way](#protocol-implementations) ([JavaScript](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs), and [Python](https://github.com/ipfs/py-ipfs)).

### Alpha Distribution

In February of 2015, the [go-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs) implementation was released as an "Alpha Distribution". Since then, go-ipfs has been making regular releases on the road towards Beta. Both [js-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs) and [py-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/py-ipfs) are in progress.

- [Setup IPFS and Getting Started](https://ipfs.io/docs/getting-started/)
- [Going Online](https://ipfs.io/docs/getting-started/#going-online)
- [More Examples](https://ipfs.io/docs/examples/)

### Security Issues and Disclosures

The IPFS protocol and its implementations are still in heavy development. This means that there may be problems in our protocols, or there may be mistakes in our implementations. And -- though IPFS is not production-ready yet -- many people are already running nodes in their machines. So we take security vulnerabilities very seriously. If you discover a security issue, please bring it to our attention right away!

If you find a vulnerability that may affect live deployments -- for example, by exposing a remote execution exploit -- please send your report privately to security@ipfs.io. Please DO NOT file a public issue.

If the issue is a protocol weakness that cannot be immediately exploited or something not yet deployed, just discuss it openly.

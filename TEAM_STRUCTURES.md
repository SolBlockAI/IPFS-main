## Description

The IPFS Project is developed by multiple teams from multiple organizations and both intermittent and continuous invidividual contributors. A structure was developed (and continues to evolve) around Working & Research Groups, OKRs, and PM best practices that were designed to support the already large and growing group of people to coordinate among each other at a global scale.

This document captures the Team Structures that emerged and that led to the many of the sucesses within the IPFS project, namely: Working Groups & Research Groups. At the end of this document, you will find pointers to Teams and Projects that have grown to become their own entities, namely: IPLD, libp2p and Multiformats.

#### One line definition

- **Working Group** - A cohesive team with measurable goals for each quarter. A Working Group needs to have a Captain, a set of people commited to it, and entry point repo and Objectives & Key Results defined per Quarter.
- **Research Group** - A set of people focused on exploring a specific vertical and output possible research surveys, tools, experiments, and other types of knowledge that can inform and help the work done by the Working Groups or spark the creation of new Working Groups all together.

#### Expanded description

**Working Groups**

Working Groups are teams of people that are appointed to research, develop, and deploy work under the working groups' scope. This structure is designed to provide clarity and direction to the project, enabling individual contributors to focus their time and energy on the areas they are most interested.

Each Working Group is free to experiment with setting their own pace, tracking work, and defining priorities. The only requirements are that the Working Group exposes its focus through OKRs to the rest of the org (common interface), that it assigns a Captain, creates an entry point repo and has at least 2 full time contributors dedicated to it.

Each contributor shouldn't carry responsibilities accross multiple working groups. This is not forbidden by any means but it is greatly discouraged as it will prevent the contributor from achieving full focus.

**Research Groups**

A set of people focused on exploring a specific vertical and output possible research surveys, tools, experiments, and other types of knowledge that can inform and help the work done by the Working Groups or spark the creation of new Working Groups all together.

Some great examples from this structure are: research-pubsub which led to the implementation of PubSub by the IPFS/libp2p teams; and research-crdt which lead to the creation of the Dynamic Data & Capabilities Working Group which todays tackles many of the challenges of building DApps on the distributed web.

A Research Group doesn't require a Captain or OKRs to be formed and having individuals that subscribe to multiple Research Groups isn't considered harmful.

A byproduct of both of these team structures achieves another important goal: making it easier for new users and contributors to subscribe to updates and get ramped up quickly to the current project focus.
